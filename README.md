# What is a Histogram?

- A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. 
- It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable and is constructed by dividing the range of the data into bins (intervals) and counting the number of data points (frequency) that fall into each bin.

    - X-axis: Represents the bins (intervals) of data.
    - Y-axis: Represents the frequency of data points within each bin.

**Usecases**
- Histograms are used to visualize the shape, spread, and central tendency of the data, helping to understand the underlying distribution (e.g., normal, skewed, or multimodal).
